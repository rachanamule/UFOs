## Summary

* As we see in the table the data is limited to certian time. There could be updated data for later years. In this webpage there is no provision to add new data this can be the drawback of this design.

* I would recommend to display the text fields as blank. The reason is if any  new person sees the page and try to filter except the one to filter all other shows defaut values. If the default values of text field are blank it may be easy to understand.

* There could be provision to add the data. So if someone has information about UFO sightings they can add to the page. So we all can have updated data as well.

* There can be posssibilty to make the results as we type the letters. Now we need to type and press enter to see the results. But it can be further modified to display the dynamic results.
